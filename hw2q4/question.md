# Question 4:

Write a program that reads from the user two positive integers, and prints the 
result of when we add, subtract multiply, divide, div and mod them.

Your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows in the 
following example:

    Please enter two positive integers, separated by a space:
    14 4
    14 + 4 = 18
    14 â€“ 4 = 10
    14 * 4 = 56
    14 / 4 = 3.5
    14 div 4 = 3
    14 mod 4 = 2
