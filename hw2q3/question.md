# Question 3:

Suppose John and Bill worked for some time and we want to calculate the total time both of
them worked. Write a program that reads number of days, hours, minutes each of them
worked, and prints the total time both of them worked together as days, hours, minutes.

Hint: Try to adapt the elementary method for addition of numbers to this use.

Your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows in the following example:

    Please enter the number of days John has worked: 2
    Please enter the number of hours John has worked: 12
    Please enter the number of minutes John has worked: 15
    
    Please enter the number of days Bill has worked: 3
    Please enter the number of hours Bill has worked: 15
    Please enter the number of minutes Bill has worked: 20
    
    The total time both of them worked together is: 6 days, 3 hours and 35 minutes.
